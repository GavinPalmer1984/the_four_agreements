## Notes by Gavin Palmer

I didnt really encounter anything new, but I took notes of the things which seem most important.

## Introduction

## Domestication And The Dream of The Planet

The outside dream hooks our attention and teaches us what to believe, beginning with the language that we speak.

We become a copy of Mamma's beliefs, Daddy's beliefs, society's beliefs, and religion's beliefs.

And this is all based on a belief system that we never chose to believe.

True justice is paying only once for each mistake.  True injustice is paying more than once for each mistake.

We don't see the truth becase we are blind.  What blinds us are all those false beliefs we have in our minds.  We have the need to be right and to make others wrong.  We trust what we believe, and our beliefs set us up for suffering.

Just being ourselves is the biggest fear of humans.  We have learned to live our lives trying to satisfy other people's demands.  We have learned to live by other people's points of view because of fear of not being accepted and of not being good enough for someone else.

During the process of domestication, we form an image of what perfection is in order to try to be good enough.  We create an image of how we should be in order to be accepted by everybody.  We especially try to please the ones who love us, like Mom and Dad, big brothers and sisters, the priests and the teacher.

We cannot forgive ourselves for not being perfect.

We judge others according to uor image of perfection as well, and naturally they fall short of our expectations.

The way we judge ourselves is the worst judge that ever existed.

##  The First Agreement
Be Impeccable with Your Word

You can speak.  What other animal on the planet can speak?  The word is the most powerful tool you have as a human; it is the tool of magic.

The word is like a seed, and the human mind is so fertile! The only problem is that too often it is fertile for the seeds of fear.  Every human mind is fertile, but only for those kinds of seeds it is prepared for.  What is important is to see which kind of seeds our mind is fertile for, and to prepare it to receive the seeds of love.

During our domestication, our parents and siblings gave their opinions about us without even thinking.  We believed these opinions and we lived in fear over these opinions like not being good at swimming, or sports, or writing.

A sin is anything that you do which goes against yourself.  Everything you feel or believe or say that goes against yourself is a sin.  You go against yourself when you judge or blame yourself for anything.  Being without sin is exactly the opposite.  Being impeccable is not going against yourself.  When you are impeccable, you take responsibility for your actions, but you do not judge or blame yourself.

We misuse the word so often, and this misuse is how we create and perpetuate the dream of hell.  Misuse of the word is how we pull each other down and keep each other in a state of fear and doubt.

If you accept the opinion, it becomes an agreement now, and you put all your power into that opinion.


Impeccability of the word will also give you immunity from anyone putting a negative spell on you.  You will only receive a negative idea if your mind is fertile ground for that idea.  When you become impeccable with your word, your mind is no longer fertile ground for words that come from black magic.

When you are impeccable with your word, you feel good; you feel happy and at peace.

Tell yourself how wonderful you are, how great you are.  Tell yourself how much you love yourself.  Use the word to break all those teeny, tiny agreements that make you suffer.

## The Second Agreement
Don't Take Anything Personally

Personal importance, or taking things personally, is the maximum expression of selfishness because we make the assumption that everything is about "me".

Nothing other people do is because of you.  It is because of themselves.  All people live in their own dream, in their own mind;  they are in a completely different world from the one we live in.  When we take something personally, we make the assumption that they know what is in our world, and we try to impose our world on their world.

You know you are wonderful.  It is not necessary to believe other people who tell you that you are wonderful.  Don't take anything personally.  Even if someone got a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  Even at that extreme.

Only by making an inventory of our agreements will we uncover all of the conflicts in the mind and eventually make order out of the chaos of the mitote.

Even if others lie to you, it is okay.  They are lying to you because they are afraid.  They are afraid you will discover that they are not perfect.  It is painful to take that social mask off.  If others say one thing, but do another, you are lying to yourself if you don't listen to their actions.

## The Third Agreement
Don't Make Assumptions

The whole war of control between humans is about making assumptions and taking things personally.  Our whole dream of hell is based on that.

We also make assumptions about ourselves, and this creates a lot of inner conflict.  "I think I am able to do this."  You make this assumption, for instance, then you discover you aren't able to do it.  You overestimate or underestimate yourself because you haven't taken the time to ask yourself questions and to answer them.  Perhaps you need to gather more facts about a particular situation.  Or maybe you need to stop lying to yourself about what you truly want.

If all humans could communicate in this way, with impeccability of the word, there would be no wars, no violence, no misunderstandings.  All human problems would be resolved if we could just have good, clear communication.

## The Fourth Agreement
Always Do Your Best

Doing your best, you are going to live your life intensely.  You are going to be productive, you are gong to be good to yourself, because you will be giving yourself to your family, to your community, to everything.  But it is the action that is going to make you feel intensely happy.  When you always do your best, you take action.  Doing your best is taking the action because you love it, not because you're expecting a reward.

When you do your best, you don't give the Judge the opportunity to find you guilty or to blame you.

When you do your best you learn to accept yourself.  But you have to be aware and learn from your mistakes.  Learning from your mistakes means you practice, look honestly at the results, and keep practicing.  This increases your awareness.

Taking action is being alive.  It's taking the risk to go out and express your dream.  This is different than imposing your dream on someone else, because everyone has the right to express his or her dream.

The first three agreements will only work if you do your best.  Don't expect that you will always be able to be impeccable with your word.  Your routine habits are too strong and firmly rooted in your mind.  But you can do your best.  Don't expect that you will never take anything personally; just do your best.  Don't expect that you will never make another assumption, but you can certainly do your best.

The Four Agreements are a summary of the mastery of transformation, one of the masteries of the Toltec.

## The Toltec Path to Freedom
Breaking Old Agreements

That is why in all the shamanic traditions in America, from Canada to Argentina, people call themselves warriors, because they are in a war against the parasite in the mind.

God is always present and the kingdom of heaven is everywhere, but first we need to have the eyes and ears to see and hear that truth.  We need to be free of the parasite.

The angel of death can teach us to live every day as if it is the last day of our lives, as if there may be no tomorrow.
